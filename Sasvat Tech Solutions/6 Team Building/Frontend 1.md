#### **1. Introduction and Background**

**Q1:** Can you introduce yourself and briefly describe your background in frontend development?  
**A:**  
"Hello, I’m [Your Name], and I have six months of experience in frontend development. I have hands-on expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and WordPress. During this time, I’ve worked on building responsive websites, customizing WordPress themes, and implementing user-friendly interfaces. My passion is to create designs that provide a seamless user experience."

**Q2:** What projects have you worked on in the past six months? Can you walk us through your favorite project?  
**A:**  
"My favorite project was creating a portfolio website for a freelance photographer. I used Bootstrap for the responsive grid layout and JavaScript to implement features like an image slider. I also customized a WordPress theme to allow the client to update their portfolio easily. It was rewarding because the client was thrilled with how user-friendly the site turned out."

#### **2. Technical Knowledge**

**HTML & CSS**  
**Q3:** Explain the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements in HTML/CSS.  
**A:**

- **Inline**: Elements like `<span>` or `<a>` take up only as much width as their content.
- **Block**: Elements like `<div>` or `<p>` take up the entire width of their container.
- **Inline-block**: Combines the features of both—elements behave like inline elements but respect width and height properties.

**Q4:** How would you create a responsive layout using CSS?  
**A:**  
"I use a combination of techniques like CSS Grid or Flexbox to structure the layout and media queries to adjust styles based on screen sizes. For example, I might switch from a two-column layout to a single-column layout for screens below 768px."

**JavaScript**  
**Q5:** What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?  
**A:**

- `var`: Function-scoped and can be redeclared.
- `let`: Block-scoped and cannot be redeclared.
- `const`: Block-scoped but used for variables that should not be reassigned.

**Q6:** Can you write a simple JavaScript function that reverses a string?  
**A:**

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
console.log(reverseString("Frontend")); // Output: "dnetnorF"
```

**Bootstrap**  
**Q7:** How does Bootstrap help in building responsive designs?  
**A:**  
"Bootstrap provides a 12-column grid system and prebuilt responsive classes like `col-md-6` or `col-sm-12` that automatically adjust layouts for different screen sizes. It also includes utility classes for margins, padding, and alignment, which simplify responsiveness."

**Q8:** What are utility classes in Bootstrap, and can you give examples of their usage?  
**A:**  
"Utility classes are pre-defined classes for styling elements quickly. For example:

- `m-3` adds margin to all sides.
- `text-center` centers the text.
- `d-flex` applies the flexbox layout."

**WordPress**  
**Q9:** How do you install and activate a WordPress theme?  
**A:**  
"In the WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Appearance > Themes**, click on **Add New**, and choose a theme from the repository or upload a .zip file. Once installed, click **Activate** to apply it to your site."

**Q10:** If a client asks for a custom WordPress design, how would you approach it?  
**A:**  
"I would first gather the client's requirements and choose a base theme. Then, I’d create a child theme to safely customize styles and functionalities. If needed, I’d use custom plugins or modify template files to meet their specific needs."

#### **3. Problem-Solving/Practical Questions**

**Q11:** How would you debug a CSS issue where the layout breaks only on smaller screens?  
**A:**  
"I would use browser developer tools to inspect the element and check applied styles. Then, I’d verify if any media queries or parent styles are causing conflicts. If needed, I’d add or adjust media queries to fix the layout for smaller screens."

**Q12:** Suppose a WordPress plugin causes a site to crash. How would you resolve this issue?  
**A:**  
"I’d access the site via FTP or hosting panel, go to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, and rename the plugin folder to deactivate it. Then, I’d investigate the issue by checking the plugin compatibility or error logs."

#### **4. Behavioral and Soft Skills Questions**

**Q13:** How do you prioritize your tasks when working on multiple projects?  
**A:**  
"I prioritize tasks based on deadlines and project impact. I break down large tasks into smaller ones and use tools like Trello or Asana to track progress. Communication with team members and clients ensures all priorities are aligned."

**Q14:** Can you describe a challenging situation in your projects and how you resolved it?  
**A:**  
"Once, a WordPress update broke the site’s functionality due to an outdated plugin. I quickly restored a backup, updated the plugin manually, and worked with the team to test all functionalities before re-launching the site."

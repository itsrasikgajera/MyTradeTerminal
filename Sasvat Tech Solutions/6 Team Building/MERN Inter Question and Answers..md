2. "Can you explain your database schema design decisions for the e-commerce platform?"
3. "What was your approach to error handling across the full stack?"
4. "How did you handle user authentication and authorization in your projects?"

Technical Coding Questions:
1. "Can you write a simple Express.js middleware for logging requests?"
2. "How would you create a reusable React component for product cards?"
3. "Write a MongoDB query to find all orders for a specific user with populated product details."
4. "Demonstrate how you would handle async operations in Node.js using async/await."

Project-Specific Questions (Based on Resume):
1. "How did you handle product inventory management in your e-commerce project?"
2. "Can you explain your implementation of the shopping cart functionality?"
3. "What challenges did you face while implementing the order management system?"
4. "How did you ensure data consistency between MongoDB and your React frontend?"

Problem-Solving Questions:
1. "If your e-commerce site suddenly experienced slow load times, how would you diagnose and fix the issue?"
2. "How would you scale your application if the user base grew significantly?"
3. "What approach would you take to implement real-time order status updates?"

Would you like me to provide example answers for any of these questions or add more questions in any particular category?

- Users collection: Customer information and authentication details
- Orders collection: Order history, payment status, and delivery information
- Cart collection: Temporary storage for user shopping sessions

Q3: "What is the purpose of Express.js middleware?"
Expected Answer:
- Middleware functions have access to request and response objects
- Can execute code, modify request/response objects
- End request-response cycle
- Call next middleware function
- Common uses: authentication, logging, error handling

INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

Q4: "In your e-commerce project, how do you handle state management in React?"
Expected Answer:
- Using React hooks (useState, useEffect) for component-level state
- Context API for global state management
- Managing shopping cart state
- Handling user authentication state
- Using local storage for persistent data

Q5: "How did you implement the Razorpay payment gateway integration in your project?"
Expected Answer:
```javascript
// Backend (Express.js)

  try {
    const instance = new Razorpay({
      key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID,
      key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_SECRET
    });

    const options = {
      amount: req.body.amount * 100,
      currency: "INR"
    };

    const order = await instance.orders.create(options);
    res.json(order);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(error);
  }
};

// Frontend (React)
const handlePayment = async () => {
  const options = {
    key: "your_razorpay_key",
    amount: amount,
    currency: "INR",
    name: "Prayosha Oil",
    description: "Purchase Description",
    handler: function(response) {
      // Handle success
      verifyPayment(response);
    }
  };
  const paymentObject = new window.Razorpay(options);
  paymentObject.open();
};
```

ADVANCED LEVEL

Q6: "How did you optimize the performance of your MERN stack application?"
Expected Answer:
- Frontend optimizations:
  - Code splitting using React.lazy()
  - Implementing lazy loading for images
  - Using memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- Backend optimizations:
  - Implementing caching using Redis
  - Database indexing in MongoDB
  - Implementing pagination for large data sets
- General optimizations:
  - Compression middleware
  - Asset optimization
  - CDN usage for static files

Q7: "Can you explain your database schema design decisions for the e-commerce platform?"
Expected Answer:
```javascript
// Product Schema
const productSchema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  description: String,
  category: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category' },
  stock: { type: Number, default: 0 },

  next();
};

app.use(requestLogger);
```

      <div className="product-info">
        <h3>{title}</h3>
        <p>{description}</p>

      {products.map(product => (
        <ProductCard 
          key={product._id}

 Starting an IT agency requires specific HR documentation to ensure smooth operations and legal compliance. Here's a list of essential HR documents you should have:

**Core Documents:**

- **Employee Handbook:** This outlines your company's policies, procedures, benefits, code of conduct, and expectations for employees.
- **Employment Contracts (Offer Letters and Agreements):** These documents formalize the terms of employment, including job title, salary, benefits, start date, and any other relevant details.
- **Job Descriptions:** Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each position to set clear expectations and attract suitable candidates.
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):** Protect your company's confidential information and trade secrets by having employees and contractors sign NDAs.
- **Independent Contractor Agreements:** If you hire freelancers or consultants, use these agreements to outline the scope of work, payment terms, and other relevant details.

**Recruitment and Onboarding:**

- **Manpower Requisition Form:** Use this form to request approval for new hires and outline the justification for the position.
- **Candidate Evaluation Forms:** Standardize your assessment of candidates during interviews and other stages of the hiring process.
- **Onboarding Checklist:** Guide new hires through the onboarding process, ensuring they complete necessary paperwork, training, and introductions.

**Performance Management:**

- **Performance Review Templates:** Establish a structured approach to evaluate employee performance, set goals, and provide feedback.
- **Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs):** If an employee's performance falls below expectations, use a PIP to outline areas for improvement and set clear expectations.
- **Disciplinary Action Forms:** Document any disciplinary actions taken against employees, including warnings, suspensions, and terminations.

**Compensation and Benefits:**

- **Compensation and Benefits Policy:** Outline your company's approach to salaries, bonuses, raises, health insurance, retirement plans, and other benefits.
- **Payroll Records:** Maintain accurate records of employee salaries, deductions, taxes, and other payroll-related information.

**Additional Documents (Optional):**

- **Training Manuals:** Develop training materials to help employees learn new skills and stay updated on industry trends.
- **Employee Surveys:** Gather feedback from employees to gauge satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and foster a positive workplace culture.
- **Emergency Contact Forms:** Collect emergency contact information for all employees to ensure their safety and well-being.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Legal Compliance:** Ensure all your HR documents comply with local labor laws and regulations. Consult a legal professional if needed.
- **Tailored Approach:** Customize your HR documents to fit your specific company culture, industry, and size.
- **Regular Updates:** Review and update your HR documents regularly to reflect changes in your business and the legal landscape.

Remember, having a solid set of HR documents is crucial for protecting your business, ensuring fair treatment of employees, and creating a positive work environment. Don't hesitate to seek professional advice if you have any questions or need assistance in developing your HR documentation.

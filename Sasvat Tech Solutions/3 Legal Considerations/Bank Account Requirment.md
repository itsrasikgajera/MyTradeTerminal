When opening a current account for your IT agency that primarily deals with overseas clients, consider the following factors:

**1. International Transaction Fees:**

- **Incoming Payments:** Look for accounts that offer low or no fees for receiving international payments. Some banks may offer special rates for businesses.
- **Outgoing Payments:** Check the fees for sending payments to different countries. Consider accounts that offer competitive exchange rates or have partnerships with international banks to reduce transfer costs.

**2. Multi-Currency Support:**

- **Holding Accounts:** If you deal with clients in multiple currencies, consider an account that allows you to hold and manage balances in different currencies. This can help you avoid unnecessary currency conversions and potentially save on fees.

**3. Online Banking and Integrations:**

- **User-Friendly Platform:** Choose a bank with a robust online banking platform that allows you to easily manage your finances, track payments, and generate reports.
- **Integration with Accounting Software:** If you use accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero, ensure the bank's platform can integrate with it to streamline your financial management.

**4. Customer Support:**

- **Availability:** Ensure the bank offers accessible customer support in case you encounter any issues with international transactions or account management.
- **Specialized Business Support:** Some banks offer dedicated support for business clients, which can be helpful for addressing specific needs related to your agency.

**5. Additional Features:**

- **Debit/Credit Cards:** Consider whether the account comes with business debit or credit cards that offer perks like cashback on international spending or travel rewards.
- **Overdraft Facility:** An overdraft facility can provide a safety net for cash flow fluctuations, especially if you have irregular payment cycles with international clients.

**6. Reputation and Stability:**

- **Research the Bank:** Choose a reputable bank with a strong track record in international banking. This can provide peace of mind regarding the security of your funds and the reliability of their services.

**Specific Recommendations for India:**

If you are in India, some banks that cater well to businesses with international clients include:

- **HDFC Bank:** Offers multi-currency accounts, online banking, and various business banking solutions.
- **ICICI Bank:** Provides a range of international banking services, including trade finance and foreign currency accounts.

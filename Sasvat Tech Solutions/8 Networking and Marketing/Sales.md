Dear Utkarsh,

I hope this email finds you well.

Firstly, I apologize for the delay in getting back to you and thank you for your patience.

Thank you for considering us for the design and development of your ERP platform. As discussed during our recent call, I have attached our pitch deck, which outlines our expertise and approach to delivering a tailored solution that aligns with your business objectives.

We would greatly appreciate an opportunity to meet and discuss the project in detail. If you are visiting Ahmedabad this week or anytime soon, I would be happy to arrange a meeting at your convenience. Alternatively, we can schedule a virtual meeting if that works better for you.

Please let me know your availability, and I will be happy to coordinate accordingly.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Rasik Gajera

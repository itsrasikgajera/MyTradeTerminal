Sure, Charmin! Here’s an email draft for you to send to Mangesh Gawade at PhonePe regarding the loyalty card services your client needs:

Subject: Request for Loyalty Card Services

Hi Mangesh,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Charmin Vasani, and I am reaching out on behalf of one of my clients based in Ahmedabad. They are interested in implementing a loyalty card system and are keen on integrating it with PhonePe. 

The proposed system would work as follows:
- Each loyalty card or coupon would feature branding specific to my client.
- The coupon would also include a QR code.
- When users scan the QR code with the PhonePe app, they would receive a certain amount of money credited to their PhonePe wallet.
- This credited amount could then be used for payments within the PhonePe ecosystem.

We believe this integration could offer significant value to our client’s customer base and enhance their overall experience.

Could we arrange a meeting to discuss the possibilities and technical requirements for this service? Please let me know a convenient time for you, and I will be happy to schedule it accordingly.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Rasik Gajera

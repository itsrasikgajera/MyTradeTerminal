### Naming an IT Agency: Exercise & Formula

**1. Understanding Your Brand Identity:**
   - **Exercise**: Write down your agency’s mission, values, and target audience. What emotions or thoughts do you want your name to evoke? 
   - **Example**: If your mission is to deliver cutting-edge technology solutions with a focus on innovation, think of words associated with technology, progress, and creativity.

**2. Keywords Brainstorming:**
   - **Exercise**: List out all relevant keywords that describe your business. Think of industry-specific terms, tech jargon, or words that reflect your core services.
   - **Example Keywords**: Tech, Digital, Code, Logic, Future, Net, Cloud, Soft, Byte, Smart, Core.

**3. Combining Elements:**
   - **Formula**: **[Core Word] + [Descriptive Word]** or **[Descriptive Word] + [Core Word]**
   - **Examples**:
     - **TechCore**
     - **CloudFusion**
     - **NetLogic**
     - **ByteWave**
     - **SmartSoft**

**4. Play with Variations:**
   - **Exercise**: Experiment with prefixes, suffixes, and word combinations to create something unique but recognizable. 
   - **Examples**:
     - Add **“ix”** or **“ly”** for a modern touch: **Codeix**, **Technoly**.
     - Combine parts of words: **Infotech** (Information + Technology).

**5. Consider Pronunciation and Memorability:**
   - **Exercise**: Say your potential names out loud. Are they easy to pronounce and remember? Avoid names that are too complex or have unusual spellings that could confuse clients.

**6. Check Domain Availability:**
   - **Exercise**: Once you have a list of potential names, check if the corresponding domain names are available. Tools like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) can help.

**7. Test with Your Audience:**
   - **Exercise**: Get feedback from potential clients, peers, or your target audience. See how they react to the names and which ones resonate the most.

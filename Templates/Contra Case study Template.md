#### **Introduction**

In collaboration with Exsai Technology, I undertook the role of UX/UI Designer to revamp their digital presence through a visually compelling landing page. Leveraging my expertise with Figma, Framer, and Typeform, the project aimed to encapsulate Exsai's unique brand identity and communicate it effectively to their audience.

#### **Discovery and Research**

To kickstart the project, I conducted a comprehensive competitive audit of leading design studios. This provided valuable insights into the industry's information architecture, helping me understand the essential landing page sections to incorporate into Exsai's landing page.

Following this, I engaged in a collaborative session with Exsai's Founder & CEO (Andrew) and Founder & Project Manager (Carolina) to grasp the essence they wanted their organization to convey. This foundational understanding guided the subsequent design decisions, ensuring alignment with the client's brand identity.

#### **Wireframing and Information Architecture**

The next phase involved creating wireframes, focusing on the optimal page structure and information flow. Each section was thoughtfully crafted, with careful consideration given to UX best practices. The wireframes served as a blueprint for the subsequent design stages.

#### **Design Iterations**

The design process delved into color schemes, backgrounds, and stylistic elements. These components were intentionally curated to resonate with Exsai's brand while maintaining a visually appealing and cohesive design. Seamless integration between Figma and Framer facilitated a smooth transition from static designs to interactive prototypes.

#### **Prototyping and Interactivity**

The landing page's dynamic features were brought to life using Framer, allowing for the seamless integration of links, drop-down menus, scrolling animations, embedded contact forms, and a distinctive navigation bar.

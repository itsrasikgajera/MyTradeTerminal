# What different ways do people communicate at work?

### 1. Face-to-face
- a strong and consistent message
- honesty and authenticity
- effective body language
- simple and expressive language

### 2. Email

- a summary of information following a meeting
- establishing procedures or finalising a policy
- confirming a deal
- sharing attachments.

**But be careful…**

- words or tone of voice can be misinterpreted
- messages may come across as too formal
- if too much content is included in the email the main idea can be overlooked
- an email cannot be deleted once it’s sent.

### 3. Social Communication

**But be careful…**

There can be issues with such an informal approach. For example, conversations can escalate quickly and your input and information can be lost in a thread. Like email, once words are written, there’s no taking them back.

### 4. Social Media

**But be careful…**

Receiving so many messages in real-time can be overwhelming. When there’s too much to take in, you can easily procrastinate, spending too much time using social channels.

### 5. Video Chat

**But be careful…**

Similar to using the telephone, although this is verbal communication, the personal element to the discussion can be lost. There can also be technological issues such as poor quality audio, time-delay responses or bad internet connection.


## Summary

Ali’s preferred form of communication is email. She likes that it allows her to take the time to think through what she wants to say. She can therefore structure comprehensive content that effectively communicates her thought process. Writing is her strength so she likes to use this to her advantage. However, email is one-directional and there can be a lot of unnecessary back and forth correspondence.

Would you speak to a child the same way you speak to an adult? Would you write an email to a friend the same way you’d write one to your manager?

1. Identify who the audience is.
2. Establish why you’re meeting them – what is your intention? Set no more than three intentions.
3. Assess why they’re meeting you.
4. Determine what you want your audience to think, feel and do.


### Case study

How would the head of the company communicate the message with the first audience: the company?

Let’s break it down into those four steps:

1. The audience is the company employees.
2. The company head is meeting them to announce the news of the app launch.
3. They are meeting with you to hear about a new development at the company.
4. They want the employees to learn and understand how the app works. They want them to share any suggestions or feedback. They also want them to share the news and to get their students and clients excited about the app launch.


>### Have a go:
  Using the example of the tutoring company, how would you choose to craft and deliver your message to the tutors?
  -  Would you choose a formal or a more personable approach?
  - How would you communicate this content differently for the clients/students?
- What would you want clients/students to think, feel and do?

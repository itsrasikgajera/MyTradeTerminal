**Subject: Credit Limit Increase Request**

**Dear ICICI Bank,**

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Rasikbhai Mansukhbhai Gajera, and I have been a credit card holder with ICICI Bank since July 2021 (Card Number: 4035 6225 0109 2003). I am writing to request an increase in my credit limit from ₹1,20,000 to ₹2,00,000.

I have consistently made timely payments and maintained a good credit standing. An increased limit would help me manage my finances more effectively.

Thank you for considering my request. Please let me know if any additional information is needed.

**Sincerely,**

Rasik Gajera

A massive misconception of what great product people do.

People think Steve Jobs was someone who could imagine great products in his mind and bring them into the world. That's incorrect. The iPhone's first iterations were terrible. He learned from his users.

If you think you're going to have an amazing solution or product on your first MVP, then you're a fake Steve Jobs. Great products come from iteration and learning from customers, not from your head.

If Steve Jobs needed many iterations to build a good product, you probably need to too.

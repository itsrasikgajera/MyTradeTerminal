Hello Dr. Naresh, 

I hope you are doing well. I’m Rasik Gajera, and I received your contact information from Milan Makani. I’m reaching out with a healthcare app concept that I believe could benefit greatly from your expertise.

The app is designed to streamline the patient experience by listing hospitals and clinics, allowing users to either book appointments or secure tokens for consultations. Patients would receive notifications about their appointment 15-20 minutes in advance, helping them avoid long wait times. The platform also provides hospitals a space to advertise, supporting their growth. As the app administrator, I would gather patient insights to understand market trends and inform future app developments.

If you’d be open to discussing this further, I would be happy to arrange a 1:1 chat or meet in person at a time that works best for you.

Thank you for considering my request, and please know that your input would be greatly valued.

Warm regards,

3. **Sales** and **Housekeeping** integrate with **Front Desk** for accurate room availability and pricing.
4. **Maintenance** ensures the operational readiness of rooms and facilities.
5. **Reports** pull data from all modules for insights and decision-making.
6. **Settings** and **Master Settings** define the core application behavior, customized for the hotel.
7. **User Management** ensures access control and operational accountability.

### **3. Sidebar Design Recommendations**

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Enable users to expand or collapse the sidebar for better screen space utilization.
- **Icon + Label**: Use intuitive icons (e.g., a house for housekeeping, gear for settings) alongside text labels for clarity.
- **Highlight Active Tab**: Visually highlight the current tab with a distinct color or underline.
- **Quick Actions**: Add a "+" icon for quick actions like new bookings or reservations.

### **4. Optional Enhancements**

- **Search Bar**: A global search bar in the header for quick access to specific data (e.g., guest name, booking ID).

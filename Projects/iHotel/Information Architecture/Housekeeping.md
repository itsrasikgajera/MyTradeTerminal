        - **Vacant & Dirty:** Needs cleaning after check-out.
        - **Under Maintenance:** Temporarily unavailable due to issues.
2. **Update Room Status**
    
    - Front desk notifies housekeeping when a room becomes vacant or a guest requests cleaning.
    - Housekeeping updates the status once cleaning or maintenance is complete.

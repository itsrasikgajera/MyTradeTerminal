### ðŸ“– Case Study

#### **The Challenge: LuvBuckets and the Road to Shark Tank**

The story begins with a unique partnership. I was invited to join forces with a web and mobile development agency located in Central Florida, working closely with a client aspiring to pitch their idea on the acclaimed TV show, Shark Tank. After a year of intensive collaboration and substantial investments, the client was far from achieving their dream.

The spark that ignited the project was the client's deep passion for preserving family memories. Driven by love and a desire to create a product capable of immortalizing legacies, they envisioned a platform where users could capture and schedule the release of cherished memories to their loved ones.

#### **The goal was ambitious: develop a hybrid iOS and Android application in just six weeks.**

A considerable challenge considering the project had been in motion for a year without a viable product.

#### **Introducing Legacy Link: A Redesigned Vision**

I played a pivotal role in reshaping the design. While respecting the core structure of Love Buckets, I infused it with fresh inspiration drawn from platforms like Pinterest, known for their exceptional content presentation. By leveraging this creative perspective, I reinvented the visual design of the product.

I assumed the lead designer role for LuvBuckets, working closely with the client and the development team. I took on the task of translating client requests into user-friendly design solutions. An example of my remarkable influence was when I transformed a client's insistence on using a confusing bucket icon into an intuitive interface design.

#### **The Outcome: Making an Impact**

Legacy Link achieved a pivotal feat. In just six weeks, my team and I managed to launch the application on both iOS and Android platforms. This was a game-changer, given that the client had invested a significant amount of money and an entire year in the project, achieving limited success.

#### **A Collaborative and Agile Approach**

The project adopted a lean startup mentality, resembling a design jam. It was all hands on deck, working together in a fast-paced, results-oriented environment. My team and I effectively turned the project around, making the most of the accelerated approach and client-focused collaboration.

#### **The Lessons Learned: An Enriching Experience**

Working on this project brought valuable lessons. I learned the art of nurturing ideas from their conception to product launch. I discovered how to work closely with first-time founders in the early stages, guiding them towards tangible outcomes. I also honed my skills in leading design projects, collaborating seamlessly with developers, and creating innovative solutions aligned with clients' needs.

#### **Conclusion: Leaving a Legacy with Legacy Link**

Legacy Link became a symbol of innovation, determination, and the power of collaboration. My journey exemplifies how a creative and agile approach can breathe life into an idea. The impact of this project, turning a year's worth of work into a six-week success, serves as a testament to the immense potential hidden within innovation and the ability to create a legacy for generations to come.

This work is a testament to the incredible results achieved when passionate individuals unite to bring a vision to life.

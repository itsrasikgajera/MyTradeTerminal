Hi Owen & Tim,

Following up on our meeting last week regarding the Morningstar Product Demo video project, I'm excited to share some examples of my past work that **could be relevant** to the project's goals.

As discussed, here are two video links showcasing projects I've delivered:

- this is figma prototype link for Coach screen as i mension in a meeting where in prototype you can go thru one by one screen and get an ideas what's the feature/tool is about with little animation. [Figma Prototype Link]
- this video is about to showcase key feature/ tol of product and also get animatin side by side how that feature will work. [Video Link]

These projects  demonstrate my experience in video animation. I believe these skills will be valuable in contributing to the success of the Morningstar Product Demo video.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further details about my experience. I'm eager to learn more about the project and how I can best contribute.

Thanks, 
Rasik

Hi Owen & Tim,

Following up on our meeting last week regarding the Morningstar Product Demo video project, I'm excited to share some examples of my past work that could be relevant to the project's goals.

As discussed, here are four video examples I found on YouTube and Figma that can serve as references for how we can build a video for your client:

1. Kadence: [https://www.youtube.com/c/kadencewp](https://www.youtube.com/c/kadencewp)
    
    - This video showcases a user performing a specific task, booking a space in their app. We can use this concept to create a video featuring a persona or user specifically completing one task relevant to your client's product.
2. Mixpanel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9jIwZC_7RtLLeU5qJ42WA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9jIwZC_7RtLLeU5qJ42WA)
    
    - In this video, the section between 0:57 and 2:16 seconds provides a good idea of what a Mixpanel dashboard looks like and how it highlights key features and tools offered by the web application. This type of video format can be helpful for creating a second video specifically showcasing the key features and tools of your client's product.
3. i-Genie Figma Prototype: [https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1227295209727026769/genie](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1227295209727026769/genie)
    
    - I've attached this link to demonstrate how coach screens can work in an app upon a user's first visit. With simple animations, we can explain each feature, tool, and its functionality.
4. SaaS Promotional Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5q_RXk_t7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5q_RXk_t7A)
    
    - This video showcases all features one by one with explanations. This format is more suited for product marketing videos and uses background music instead of voiceover narration.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further details about my experience. I'm eager to learn more about the project and how I can best contribute.

Thanks, Rasik

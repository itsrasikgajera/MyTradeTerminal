Hi Davide,

Absolutely, I can help with creating a demo video for your product using callouts and slides.

To get a clear idea of the desired output, would it be possible to grant me access to the sample video?

Thanks, Rasik

Hello Paul,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the development of a demo video for one of your products. I'm certainly interested and equipped to assist with this task.

I specialize in creating demo videos for digital products, including incorporating visual callouts and voiceovers as necessary to effectively communicate key features and functionalities. However, I would need access to the video you provided in the link to better understand the style and content required for this project.

Unfortunately, the link provided seems to require specific permissions for access. Could you please grant me access or provide an alternative way for me to view the video? This would greatly help in aligning the output with your expectations and ensuring a successful outcome.

Once I have had the opportunity to review the video, I can provide further insights and discuss how we can proceed with the project.

Looking forward to your prompt response and collaboration.

Best Regards, 
Rasik

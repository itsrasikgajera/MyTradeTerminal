Hello Janvi,

My name is Rasik Gajera. Milan Makani from Ishwariya connected us, mentioning you create explainer videos, and I'd love to discuss a project with you (if you're available).

I'm currently working on creating two explainer videos for a software product developed by a client. The first video will showcase the user journey for purchasing a product, highlighting the entire process from start to finish. The second video will focus on explaining a key feature of the software.

I'd be grateful for the opportunity to chat with you about your availability and how your explainer video expertise could benefit this project. Would you be free for a quick call today or tomorrow to discuss this further?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

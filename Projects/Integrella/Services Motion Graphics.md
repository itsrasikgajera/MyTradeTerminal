1. **Staff Augmentation:**
   - Sketch a scene with a central figure representing the core team of a company.
   - Surround this figure with smaller figures (representing augmented staff) joining the central team temporarily, symbolizing the concept of adding specialized skills or resources to an existing team.
   - Show these augmented staff members holding tools or resources that represent their expertise (e.g., a developer holding a laptop, a designer with a stylus and tablet).

2. **Software Development Teams:**
   - Depict a cohesive team sitting around a table or standing in a circle, symbolizing collaboration and teamwork.
   - Each team member could be represented by a different character or icon, highlighting diversity in roles (e.g., developers, designers, project managers).
   - Show thought bubbles or speech bubbles indicating communication and brainstorming among team members.

3. **Software Development Outsourcing:**
   - Illustrate a split screen with two contrasting scenes: one showing an in-house team working diligently, and the other showing a company logo being handed over to an external entity.
   - Use arrows or visual cues to depict the flow of work from the company to the outsourced team, emphasizing the transfer of responsibility.
   - Show communication channels between the company and the outsourcing team (e.g., email, phone) to highlight the remote nature of the relationship.

For motion graphics, you can animate these sketches to add dynamism and bring the concepts to life. Incorporate movement, transitions, and visual effects to emphasize the differences between each approach effectively.

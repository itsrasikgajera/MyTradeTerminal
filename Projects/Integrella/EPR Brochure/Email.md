Hi Marcus,

Thank you for the update.

I apologize, but I'm currently unable to access the file you mentioned. Could you please confirm if it's the same one you shared earlier? If so, I'll refer to that copy.

Regarding the brochure, I think breaking it into 3-4 parts is a fantastic idea. This approach will not only expedite the design process but also allow for quicker decision-making. Once one part is designed and approved, we can seamlessly move on to the next part. Let's aim to elevate this brochure to another level!

As for scheduling a call, I'm available today afternoon, Indian time. Please let me know a time that works for both you and Shaz, and we can discuss how to enhance the brochure further.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards, 
Rasik

Hello Marcus,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to submit the design files for the EPR Brochure for your review. Please find attached the PDF and PPT versions of the design, as well as a link to the Figma prototype.

PDF & PPT: [Link]

In the Figma prototype, you'll have the ability to comment directly on the design. This will facilitate smoother communication and allow for precise feedback. Please feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or revisions directly within the Figma platform.

Your feedback is invaluable in ensuring that the design meets our objectives and requirements. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the design, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Shaz,

Thank you for your detailed feedback on the brochure. We appreciate the time and thought you’ve put into your comments.

If you have any additional feedback to convey, we can set up a call to discuss it further. Additionally, when Marcus is in Ahmedabad, I will gather his feedback as well. We can then have a joint call to discuss and consolidate all the feedback. This way, we ensure that both your and Marcus’s insights are incorporated into the brochure.

Once I have all the feedback, I will start working on the revisions to cover all the points raised.

Thanks again for your valuable input.

Best regards,

Hi Shaz,

I apologize for the delay in responding; I have been busy with the NOW Wireless PoC design given by Neil and Paul over the past 20 days.

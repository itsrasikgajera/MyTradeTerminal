Hi Neil,

Hope this message finds you well. 

RK here. I hope you're doing great. I just wanted to touch base regarding the product engineering brochure. In order to finalize the last page, i require some essential details from you. Could you kindly provide the following information at your earliest convenience?

1. Photo
2. Name
3. Position Title
4. Email Address
5. Personal Phone Number (if available)

Once we have these details, we'll be able to swiftly wrap up the brochure. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
RK

Hi Neil,

Thank you for sharing the details. I've completed the brochure design incorporating the necessary changes as per the information provided. Please find attached the updated brochure PDF for your review.

Hi Neil,

I'm glad you're pleased with the changes! I understand your concern about the file size limitation. I'm currently working on compressing the PDF to reduce its size while maintaining the quality as much as possible. However, if we find it difficult to compress it to less than 2 MB without significant quality loss, we can consider providing a download link instead of attaching the PDF directly to the email. This way, recipients can access the document by clicking the link, and it won't be subject to file size limitations.

I'll keep you updated on the progress, and let me know if you have any further questions or preferences regarding this.

Best regards,
Rasik

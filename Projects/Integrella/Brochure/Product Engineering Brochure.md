Hello Paul,  
  
I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to submit the design in progress for the Product Engineering Brochure. Please find the link to the design here:   
  
- Option 1 : [**Link for Option 1**](https://www.figma.com/proto/d4fMG9MRM0npW2VadpZFzz/Deck---Product-Engineering?type=design&node-id=13-48&t=fneFoDYajgPEQdze-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=7%3A2&starting-point-node-id=13%3A48&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)  
- Option 2 :   [**Link for Option 2**](https://www.figma.com/proto/d4fMG9MRM0npW2VadpZFzz/Deck---Product-Engineering?type=design&node-id=36-204&t=fneFoDYajgPEQdze-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=7%3A2&starting-point-node-id=36%3A204&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)  
- Option 3 :   [**Link for Option 3**](https://www.figma.com/proto/d4fMG9MRM0npW2VadpZFzz/Deck---Product-Engineering?type=design&node-id=51-7496&t=fneFoDYajgPEQdze-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=7%3A2&starting-point-node-id=51%3A7496&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)  
  
Additionally, I would like to mention that the document size for this design is 1920x1080 pixels. I have chosen this size to align with common presentation standards as it is widely used and ensures compatibility with various display devices. While landscape A4 size is standard for printed documents, the 1920x1080 size is better suited for digital presentations.  
  
Please review the design and feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. I am open to making adjustments to ensure the final product meets the project requirements.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your feedback.  
  
Best regards,

Follow-Up: Brochure Design Options

Hello Paul,

I trust this message finds you well.

Following our recent conversation, I've carefully considered your requirements for the brochure design. I am pleased to inform you that I am ready to present three distinct options that align with the discussed preferences.

Attached to this email, you will find the mock-ups for your review. I have incorporated two landscape formats and one portrait format to ensure a comprehensive range of choices. Each design adheres to the brand guidelines we discussed earlier.

Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am available for additional discussions or modifications as needed.

Looking forward to your feedback and the opportunity to refine the designs based on your preferences.

Best regards,
Rasik Gajera

Subject: Follow-up: Brochure Design Options

Hello Paul,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to follow up on the email I sent two days ago regarding the brochure design options. I understand that everyone's schedule can get busy, and I wanted to gently remind you to review the mock-ups I've prepared for your consideration.

Your feedback is incredibly valuable in ensuring that we align perfectly with your vision. Whether you have suggestions for modifications or if there are specific elements you'd like to discuss further, I'm here to accommodate any adjustments needed.

Please take a moment to review the attached mock-ups at your earliest convenience. Your input will allow us to proceed smoothly with the next steps of the project. If there are any other tasks or aspects you'd like to prioritize, feel free to let me know, and we can adjust accordingly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, Paul. I look forward to hearing your thoughts soon.

Best regards,

Hi Paul,

Thank you for your swift response and clear direction on Option 2. I'm glad to hear it aligns with your preferences, and we're ready to proceed with it for the remaining pages.

Regarding your questions about sharing content and providing visual feedback, I'm absolutely open to using Figma for collaboration. You can add comments inline directly within Figma, which will streamline the process for fine-tuning the details. I appreciate your specific notes on areas for improvement, such as enlarging images, addressing spelling/grammar issues, and adjusting wording.

for commenting in figma you can refert this link : https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574-Add-comments-to-files 

Regarding the removal of the "Client Background" page, duly noted. I'll ensure it's removed from the drafts. We can certainly find a suitable place for the logos elsewhere, as per your suggestion.

For the last slide, "Product Development," incorporating iconography or different formatting sounds like a great idea to enhance visual appeal and clarity. Once we finalize a visual direction, I'll integrate your summarized text into the design. Thank you for providing the process for making comments in Figma; I'll make sure to follow that moving forward.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further feedback or if there are additional changes you'd like to discuss. Looking forward to continuing our collaboration and refining the project further.

Best regards,
Rasik Gajera

Hi Paul,

Thank you for your prompt and clear feedback on Option 2. I'm happy to hear it aligns with your vision, and I'm ready to implement it for the remaining pages.

For content sharing and feedback, I'd love to try using Figma for collaboration. It lets you add comments directly within the design files, making it easy to pinpoint specific details needing fine-tuning. Here's a guide for commenting in Figma if you're unfamiliar: [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574-Add-comments-to-files](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574-Add-comments-to-files)

I've noted your suggestion about removing the "Client Background" page. I'll remove it from the drafts and explore incorporating the logos elsewhere in a relevant context.

Adding iconography or distinct formatting to the final "Product Development" slide sounds like a fantastic idea. I'll also consider applying similar enhancements to the other service pages for consistency.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any further feedback or additional changes you might have. I'm excited to continue collaborating and refining this project with you.

Best regards,

Rasik Gajera

Subject: Re: Feedback and Havencare Case Study

Hi Paul,

Thanks for checking in! I appreciate the feedback, and yes, it makes perfect sense. I'm currently working on incorporating the comments from Figma in the next draft.

In terms of the Havencare case study, I agree that reviewing the revised draft with the updated feedback is crucial before moving forward. This will ensure consistency across the entire project. Once we've finalized the first draft, I'd be happy to discuss how you'd like to share the additional content, including the feature list and statistics.

Please let me know if you have any questions or further feedback.

Thanks,

Rasik

Give me reply of this email i get by client 

"Rasik, did the feedback make sense - are you working okay on next draft? Anything i can clarify?  

I have some more content for the havencare case study: feature list and some statistics. Let me know how you want me to provide these or i can hold onto these until next draft is ready.

Thank you 

Paul  "

Hi Paul,

Thanks for checking in! I appreciate the feedback, and yes, I've addressed all the comments you left in Figma. It's ready for review whenever you have a chance.

Regarding the additional Havencare case study content, I believe it would be most efficient for me to receive everything at once. That way, I can ensure consistency across the entire document before moving on to new pages.

If you have any additional feedback or suggestions on the existing pages before I proceed to the new ones, please don't hesitate to share them. It's better to address everything now for a smooth transition.

Once I have all the content and your final feedback on the Figma revisions, I'll start working on the new pages, maintaining consistency throughout.

Thanks again for your support, Paul.

Best regards,

Rasik

Hi Paul,

Thanks for checking in! I appreciate the feedback on the Figma design, and I've addressed all the comments you left. It's now ready for your review.

Regarding the Havencare case study content, I think receiving all the available information, including the feature list and statistics, would be very helpful. Having everything at once will allow me to maintain consistency throughout the entire case study.

Additionally, it would be fantastic if you could review the remaining Figma comments on the other pages before we move forward. This will ensure a consistent and polished look across all the pages. If you have any further suggestions or feedback before we delve into the next pages, I'd be happy to hear them and incorporate them.

I'm available for a 1:1 discussion until 9 PM IST, so feel free to schedule one whenever you have time. We can go over the Figma design in detail and discuss the Havencare case study content further.

Thanks, 
Rasik

Hi Priyesh,

I'm designing a HavenCare project case study for product engineering brochure. Vipul Makwana mentioned you lead the project technically. Your insights are crucial for a compelling case study.

To showcase the project effectively, I need:

- 4-5 key project screenshots (UI, user flow, etc.)
- Briefly outline your team's key services for HavenCare.
- List the primary technologies used.

To gather this information and ensure an accurate portrayal of the project, I'd appreciate scheduling a brief meeting with you at your convenience. Please let me know your availability, and I'll be happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks!

Dear Paul,

Apologies for the delayed response. Regarding the PDF, I have attempted to compress it to 6 MB, but it may still be too large for email delivery. I suggest hosting the PDF on our server and providing a download link to the client. Alternatively, I am working on converting the PDF to a PowerPoint presentation, which could be more manageable.

As for the Twing Education case study structure, I have created an initial framework and incorporated images and tech stack information from Raj and Paras. Please provide your feedback on the work so far.

If possible, I would appreciate a brief 15-minute call on Monday morning to discuss the case study and ensure its timely completion.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Hello Paul,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a timeline extension for the Product Engineering Brochure that we have been working on. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have been assigned another high-priority task that requires immediate attention.

I want to assure you that I remain committed to the successful completion of the Product Engineering Brochure. However, the additional workload has created some time constraints, and I believe that a reasonable extension would allow me to deliver a high-quality outcome without compromising on the project's objectives.

I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and am committed to working diligently on both assignments simultaneously. I will ensure that the quality of my work remains uncompromised, and I am confident that the extension will not have a significant impact on the overall project timeline.

I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. If there are any specific concerns or expectations you have regarding the revised timeline, please let me know, and I will do my best to address them.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

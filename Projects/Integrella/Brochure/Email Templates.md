Hello Paul,

So sorry for the delay! I apologize that you haven't seen any updates last week. i'm busy due to family function. but not i'm fully availble.

I'm actually happy to report that the design is complete and ready to go! I've attached the link for you to review [link to design].

Let me know what you think and we can incorporate any feedback you have. With the design finalized, we should definitely be able to finish the brochure within the two-week timeframe.

Regarding the slide deck from the founders' wife, I'd be happy to collaborate on that once the brochure is complete. We can definitely discuss kicking it off as a separate workstream if needed, but my priority is getting the brochure finished first.

Best Regards, 
Rasik Gajera

Dear Paul,

Please accept my apologies for the delay in receiving an update on the brochure design. I understand the importance of timely communication and regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

Due to a recent family commitment, I was unavailable to provide an update last week. However, I am now fully available and pleased to inform you that the brochure design is complete!

I have attached the design for your review [link to design]. Please take your time to examine it thoroughly and provide any feedback you may have. We can then incorporate your suggestions to ensure the final design meets your expectations.

With the design finalized, I am confident we can complete the brochure within the two-week timeframe we previously discussed.

Regarding the slide deck you mentioned from the founders' wife, I would be happy to collaborate on that once the brochure is finalized. We can certainly discuss initiating it as a separate project if needed. However, my primary focus at this time is on completing the brochure to a high standard.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Havencare case study slides. Unfortunately, I don't have them in PowerPoint format, as they were designed using Figma. However, I'm more than happy to provide you with access to the Figma file so that you can make any necessary updates or changes.

Please let me know if you're comfortable with this approach, and I will promptly share the file access with you. Once you have access, feel free to add comments or edits directly to the file, and I'll ensure that all your changes are incorporated.

4. Type your comment in the text box and hit Enter or click the "Add Comment" button.
5. Your comment will now be visible, and others collaborating on the file can reply to it or resolve it once addressed.

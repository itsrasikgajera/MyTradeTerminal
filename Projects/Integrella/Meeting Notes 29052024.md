**Presentation Screen Design**  
_Discussion of designing presentation screens without branding for a prospect meeting._

**Alert Screen Design**  
_Discussion of designing a new alerts screen with different components._  

**Ideas:** Neil proposes designing a new alerts screen with sections for filtering alerts by time period, severity, and search/filter options. Rasik agrees to design this. [07:43](https://tldv.io/app/meetings/6657350528dc4800133dac4d?t=463)

**Dashboard Design Proposal**  
_Discussion around designing a dashboard that can overlay different device and journey time data on a single map view._

Hello Paul,

I am pleased to submit all the designs we discussed. Please find the Figma links below:

1. Final Flow with summary, transcript all together: [Figma Link]
2. New option for Start/stop button & new recording visuals like ECG: [Figma Link]
3. Sample Mobile Version for 2 Screens: [Figma Link]
4. Sample iPad Version for 2 Screens: [Figma Link]

Regarding the request to "Package up and send all digital copies (web, iPad, mobile) to David so he can use in pitch decks, etc.", David can easily export everything using the View option in Figma. However, I can share everything once the start & stop button and the whole flow are approved.

Additionally, Paras is arranging a meeting with all team members on Monday. During this meeting, I can provide a full KT and discuss any other exporting items needed by the developers.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Rasik Gajera

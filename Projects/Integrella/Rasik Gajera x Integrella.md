**Subject:** Update on Service Rates for Upcoming Engagements

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a pleasure working together over the past year, and I greatly appreciate the trust and opportunities you have extended to [Your Companyâ€™s Name]. I am committed to maintaining the quality and dedication you expect from our collaboration.

As part of my ongoing commitment to delivering the best service and support, I am implementing a small adjustment to my daily rate. Starting from [Effective Date], the daily rate for my services will be updated to 3000 INR (a 20% increase). This adjustment reflects the rising costs of resources necessary to provide you with excellent results and ensures I can continue to meet your needs effectively.

If you have any questions about this adjustment or would like to discuss further, please feel free to reach out. I am more than happy to discuss how we can continue achieving your goals together.

Thank you once again for your understanding and continued partnership. I look forward to many more successful projects together.

Warm regards,

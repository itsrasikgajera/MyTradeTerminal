Hello Vipul,


I have created three options for the TES logo, which you can find in the attachment.

Additionally, I have designed 10 options for the LinkedIn banner, and I've attached all of them as PNG files. If you have any feedback, I've also included a link to the Figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/7JIAqCzGy5d4ftqnZbrG5T/Integrella---Rasik-Gajera?node-id=75-6652

Please note that the animation and icon-based solution architect diagram is still pending, but I will start working on it tomorrow.

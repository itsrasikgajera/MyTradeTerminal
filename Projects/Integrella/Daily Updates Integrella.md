Hello, good morning. Regarding the Excel sheet you recently shared and the given images:

1. Mohan Kumar and Pavankumar Yadav's names are missing in the Excel sheet.
2. According to the Excel sheet, the person's name is listed as Anilkumar Vaghari, but in the given image, it is mentioned as Anilkumar Vaghela. Please clarify which name should be considered.
3. Photos of new joiners/trainees are missing. I will communicate with Vipul sir first and let you know if they are required.

Hi Vipul,

Thanks for letting me know about the Wordfence plugin! I've deactivated it to stop those annoying alerts. Sorry for the trouble!

I'll review our setup thoroughly to make sure this doesn't happen again. I'll also personally fix Tony's email settings in Wordfence myself. Your feedback is really important to me, and I'm determined to get this right.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Best,
Rasik Gajera

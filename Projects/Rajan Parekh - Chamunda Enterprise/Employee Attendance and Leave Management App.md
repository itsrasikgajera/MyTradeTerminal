**Project Overview**

This document outlines the design requirements for a mobile application that simplifies employee attendance tracking, leave management, and communication within a company. The focus is on creating a user-friendly and cost-effective solution with a limited budget.

**Target Users**

This app is primarily designed for employees to manage their attendance and leave requests. Additionally, managers can use the app to review and approve leave requests, potentially through a separate web dashboard (consider cross-platform access).

**Project Goals**

- Enhance employee self-service for attendance and leave management.
- Streamline communication between employees and managers regarding leave requests.
- Improve data accuracy and accessibility for attendance and leave information.
- Facilitate a user-friendly and intuitive mobile experience.

**App Screens and Functionality**

**1. Login/Signup Screen:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Allow secure login with existing credentials or account creation.
    - Consider optional social logins for convenience (depending on security needs).
    - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security (highly recommended).
- **Data:**
    - Username or email address
    - Password
    - Secure storage of credentials

**2. Home Screen (Main Dashboard):**

- **Functionality:**
    - Provide a clear overview of key attendance and leave information at a glance (e.g., clock in/out status, remaining leave balances, upcoming events).
    - Utilize visual aids like charts, graphs, or color-coded indicators for easier data comprehension.
    - Offer quick access to frequently used functions like clock in/out, leave requests, and profile management.
- **Data:**
    - Current date and time
    - Today's clock in/out status (present, late, absent)
    - Remaining leave balances (sick leave, vacation leave, etc.)
    - Upcoming shifts or deadlines (if applicable)

**3. Clock In/Out Screen:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Enable effortless clock in/out for employees.
    - Consider optional features:
        - Geolocation tracking with clear user consent and company policy guidelines.
        - Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) with user opt-in for secure authentication.
        - Option to add notes or explanations for clock in/out actions (e.g., late arrival reason).
- **Data:**
    - Current date and time
    - Geolocation data (if enabled, with user consent)
    - Optional: Clock in/out notes

**4. Overtime Screen (Optional):**

- **Functionality:**
    - Track and display overtime hours worked (if applicable).
    - Allow for submitting overtime requests for approval within the mobile app or a cross-platform accessible web dashboard (consider manager access).
    - Enable managers to review and approve/deny overtime requests.
- **Data:**
    - Overtime hours automatically calculated based on clock in/out data and approved requests.
    - Overtime request details (date, duration, reason)

**5. Leave Management Screen:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Facilitate employee leave requests (sick leave, vacation, etc.).
    - Offer a clear leave request process, including selection of leave type, duration, and optional explanations.
    - Enable managers to view, approve/deny leave requests, and track employee leave balances.
    - Consider calendar integration for visualizing leave schedules and avoiding conflicts.
- **Data:**
    - Leave types and their available balances
    - Leave request details (type, duration, dates, reason, status)

**6. User Profile Screen:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Allow for employee profile management.
    - Separate sections for personal, professional, and other (customizable) information.
    - Consider including emergency contact details, preferred communication channels, or other company-specific profile fields.
    - Enable management of notification preferences (e.g., email alerts for approvals, reminders).
- **Data:**
    - Personal information (optional: name, phone number, address)
    - Professional information (e.g., job title, department, manager)
    - Other customizable information (e.g., emergency contacts)
    - Communication preferences

**Low-Budget Considerations**

- Prioritize core functionalities (attendance, leave) for initial development.
- Leverage open-source libraries or UI kits whenever possible.
- Design a clean and user-friendly interface that requires minimal design resources.
- Consider a phased development approach, focusing on essential features first.
- Utilize user testing to gather feedback and iterate on the design efficiently.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app complies with relevant accessibility guidelines.
- **Offline Functionality:** Explore enabling basic app functionalities offline (e.g., viewing attendance history)

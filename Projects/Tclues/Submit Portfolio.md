Hello Rakesh,

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss providing design services for your company. I'm excited about the prospect of working together.

As we discussed, I'd be happy to share my portfolio with you. Please find it attached to this email. The portfolio showcases some of my recent design work across various domains, including SaaS Platform, Website design, and Mobile app Design. I believe it will give you a good sense of my skills and design aesthetics.

Regarding our meeting tomorrow at 12 pm, you've confirmed the details, so I'll be there on time.

I look forward to discussing your design needs in more detail and exploring how I may be able to assist you. If you need any additional information from me before our meeting, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to provide what you need.

Thank you again, and I look forward to our discussion.

Best regards,

Rasik Gajera

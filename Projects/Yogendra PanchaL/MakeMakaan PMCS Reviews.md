### 1. Dashboard Screen - Main users are employees

1. Dashboard should have two views, one for studio owner/team lead and another for individual employees.
	1. a. Owner sees a project based view of all updates from today, yesterday etc. 
	2. b. Team lead also sees project based view of the projects their teams are handling based on today, yesterday, last 7 days etc.
2. The main purpose of dashboard is for the individual users to come in in the morning and seeing what all tasks have been assigned and deadlines that have been set, for them to start prioritising based on given deadlines. Dashboard is most important for employees, less for studio owners/team leads, owner/leads only see who’s been assigned what and who’s doing what in a project based view but the employee’s day to day work is heavily based on the dashboard. 
3. The view should be first - highlighted in red showing task name “abc” delayed by xyz hours, or highlighted in orange showing deadline is approaching. If no deadlines passed, simply starts with today - yesterday, past 7 days etc 
4. View will normally be based on when things are assigned but a toggle for sorting based on deadline set should also be available for prioritising tasks accordingly.

1. Project tab should be renamed to “new project” instead and should contain a few ready to edit and start project templates like for just design consultation template, just interior template, turnkey template or create new from scratch etc. 2. Owner can start a new project by editing templates and adding new or removing unnecessary bits or by creating a new project from scratch, assign team lead, employees etc based on roles, tasks and add notes of what the expectations are and timelines mentioned and budgets etc. 3. Once new project has been created and information has been added and roles have been assigned and tasks based on deadlines have been set then this new project gets added into “CLIENTS” tab but rename it to “Project WIP” - This is all being done by studio owner.

ALT

### 3. Client Screen - Main Users are Owner and Team Leads.

ALT

~~1. Once a new project has been created by the owner, it can be viewed and opened from “clients tab”, rename clients tab to “Project WIP”
2. When individual “client/project wip card” is opened, it should open the view of project screen with all info ready to get the project started for team lead and all employees to see and get going. Updates from employees about tasks that are “in review” should reflect here, “in review” tasks can be reviewed by team lead/owner and only lead/owner can share reviewed work/files to client dashboard if they are satisfied or else, push back to employee’s to-do with relevant feedback and updated deadline.
3. Updates from client about approval/rejection/reviews etc should reflect in here and owner/lead can assign this back to relevant employees. 
4. All approved files from clients should be saved separately under the label of “Done/Approved by client” so these approved files can be accessed easily from the individual client’s project WIP card.

### 4. Kanban Screen - Main use case is to-dos for employees/leads/owner

Programma HQ’s “To Do” section for inspiration. Images if available should be shown in task list so things are graphical and not just textual since designers think in visuals mostly.

This will be private to the user and they can add their own personal to-do in here as well which may or may not be needing time tracking and file upload. User can add their own task and label them as private for privacy of their own personal to-dos. 
1. ~~Rename KANBAN to “My To-Dos” - this has multiple use cases, can act as a sticky note of to-dos with option to directly delegate task from the sticky note itself for owner or team lead. Main use case is for employees to see the tasks allotted to them with deadlines. Dashboard serves as daily morning update and My to-dos serves as actionable tasks allotted to employees to get started on.~~ 
~~2. Labels should be - 
	1. a. “To-do” - sorted by deadlines. 
	2. b. “in progress/doing” - whenever goes from to-do to doing, a start timer should be presented so employees can start tracking time it takes to complete task and productivity can be monitored by lead or owner. 
	3. c. “send for review” - once tasks are pushed from “doing” to “in review”, employee should be prompted to upload all necessary files and only after files are uploaded, the task will go from “doing” to in review and timer for that task will stop. 
	4. d. Once employee sends task with all files to “in review” - lead and owner get notified in the respected “Proj WIP” card and can review the work first before sending to client dashboard. (Only lead/owner can send to client dashboard, such permissions should be allowed via options when assigning roles in “start new proj”) 
	5. e. Review from clients - this as mentioned earlier, is shown within the “Proj WIP” tab and based on reviews can be re-assigned back to employees and will go back in the to-do with deadline till client says GOOD JOB. 
	6. e. Once client says yes, this is approved. Only then lead/owner can assign it as done from their end and it will reflect back to employee’s to-do tab under “done”~~

### 5. Analytics Screen - Main users are Owner or Team-Lead

![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbca3f8af-77b0-4c1b-a1ca-2eac8e92cc1d%2F35fe5be5-9933-43b8-a663-57d748dc9947%2F9a3713f5-d0dd-4d0d-b9f0-cced09e158d2.jpg?table=block&id=313f4100-8be6-4feb-a1b4-04331666c650&spaceId=bca3f8af-77b0-4c1b-a1ca-2eac8e92cc1d&width=2000&userId=cb2e0cb9-91d2-46b6-bf33-234901a457b7&cache=v2)

ALT

1. Analytics should serve two purposes, one for studio owner for overall studio’s analytics and another for team lead for the projects their teams are handling. 2. Usage of analytics is only for studio owner and team lead, other employees/interns don’t need to see analytics. 3. Make a drop down menu to filter/select what all cards to show actively in analytics and make all analytics cards into organisable widgets so user can drag and drop and organise the view based on what’s most important for them to be at top and so on. 4. Remove messages from analytics because new notifications should only reflect on “messages” in main menu and not in both messages and analytics. 5. Keep Project Categories and Important Projects. Change space for “manage project in one touch” to organisable analytics tab with filters etc. 6. Analytics for studio owner: a. GNATT Chart with detailed project execution timeline should open when opening project cards in “Important Projects”, should also show graphic project details like 2D drawings that have been updated according to workflow and timeline, and a “share to client dashboard” option. (Important project can be viewed in one scrollable line or in 4 cards or 6 cards etc to show all projects in one view) b. Resource allocation of studio (man power) that shows who’s working on what and their time tracking so owner can see what things are being executed in how much time. c. Cash flow of studio, total to come, how much has come, payment cycle based on work completion, when will the next payment come, after what stage etc. d. New client interactions - if clients have reviewed and sent suggestions or approved/rejected things, should reflect in analytics based on no. of revisions or delay in responding back in time based on given deadline for update (to monitor firms productivity). GNATT chart with project timeline, resource allocation, Cash flows and new client interactions should replace the blocks of both project statistics, total clients, total tasks done, new projects etc, current balance and workload dashboard for CMS website. 7. Analytics for team lead: Not too informative, only shows what’s needed for team lead to have overview of progress. a. Pending tasks showing who’s allotted what and their time tracking. b. Client’s budget and seeing if we are within or going beyond budget, if beyond then why. c. Quotes from vendors and consultants to keep record of quotations etc. d. Important Projects tab that their team is handling.

### 6. Messages Screen - Main users are everyone within the studio.

This acts as a mood-board for employees, lead, owner etc as their own individual design inspiration diary like Pinterest and they can add file, images, short vids etc based on labels/topics/rooms/project names for their own record.

Although this will be private to the user, they can share their design inspiration files via message to other people and they can add it to their own mood board.

### Client Dashboard as an independent webpage and not within studio PMCS tool

One WhatsApp bot sends all updates from studio to clients based on their respectful projects with links saying “Hi xyz, there is an update in your project. You can review and let us know what you think in comments through this link”

Client Dashboard screen would show updates and files and all relevant information based on stages of project and how things are progressing and if we are still on schedule for completion within the expected timeline.

Client can open files, read documents, download files and reviews can be shared via comments within the dashboard. These updates are shown directly in individual Proj WIP screen to the studio and lead/owner can allot task further to employees or done etc.

1. For the Open Position screen, I know it’s finalized with just one screen. But before finalizing, I gave 7-8 different options with layout and background color changes. I’m only charging for 3 of those now.
2. For the Schedule Interview screen, there’s only 1 screen, but I included 4 use cases that might happen on the same screen. So, I’m charging for 2 screens for this one.
3. Even if you provide a sample screen, it doesn't mean my design effort will be less. Whatever design style we are following, I’ll make sure to match all designs.

1) If you are considering open position as 7-8 different options - please send me let's review how much diff we have for each screens.
2) Schedule Interview - it's just popup and for diff use case there was small changes not much.
3) Yes, definitely you spend time for design screens and it's required effort but for ideas & sample screens details are provided and then you converted.

Here is the rephrased version in more conversational Indian English style:

1. To facilitate an efficient review process, could you please send me the specific details or criteria you want us to focus on for each screen? This will help me accurately measure and present the differences for your review.
2. As you mentioned, there are only small changes, so the effort is minimal. Also, since we're following a flat fee, I'm considering 2 screens.
3. For that, please let me know how I can give you pricing when you give me ideas on what to do, and then I create the designs.

1) You considering that you have designed 7-8 screens for open position - send me those all screens, then we will review
2) Generally for popup screens it's not required to design a full pages (this is just form based pages not required more things like images etc....)
3) I mean I also need to provide same details. generally you have to provide samples.

I thought you will remember that we redesigning same screens and not consider screens like you provided I quote. I told you for cost and then you said I will not consider more, consider 1 screen, Are you remember?

1. Please find figma link as an attachment where you can find all screens i have given as Option for Open Position Module.
2. still i designed a Pop-up screens and i telling again we're following fixed cost for Design that's why I covered this into Invoice.
3. anyway what data client wanted to showcase and sample screen if given by client it not means my design effort will less.

If there is 2 screen given for Sample than I definitely not covered but here my effort is also more and here I'm considering 1 screen only

1. Please find the Figma link attached. It has all the screens for the Open Position Module.

2. I have also designed pop-up screens. We follow a fixed cost for design, so these are included in the invoice.

3. The data and sample screens given by the client do not reduce the design effort needed.

4. If only two sample screens were needed, I wouldn't have included them, but my work covered more than just one screen.

**Notes:**

- This is a sample dataset and can be customized based on your specific project requirements.
- The number of tasks, sub-tasks, and sub-sub tasks can vary depending on the project complexity.
- You can add additional columns to the spreadsheet as needed, such as resources, costs, and risks.
- The Gantt chart can be created using the start and end dates for each task.


=IF(B5 < E8, 0, IF(B5 > G8, 100, (B5 - E8) / (G8 - E8) * 100))

- Cell A1 contains the start date.
- Cell B1 contains the end date.
- Cell C1 contains the current date.
- Cell D1 will contain the percentage completion.

=IF(AND($C14="Goal",I$7>=$F14,I$7<=$F14+$G14-1),2,IF(AND($C14="Milestone",I$7>=$F14,I$7<=$F14+$G14-1),1,""))


For example, if the start date is in column B, the end date is in column C, and the duration is in column D, then the formula in cell D2 would be C2-B2 or C2-B2+1. 

You can also use the following formulas to calculate other values in a Gantt chart: Start date + Duration = End date, End date – Duration = Start date, and =max(B2)+1. 

Here are some other formulas you can use in a Gantt chart: =AND(D$4>=$B5,D$4<=$C5), =AND(date>=start,date<=end), =INT(B3)-INT($B$3), and =INT(E10)-INT(D10)+1.

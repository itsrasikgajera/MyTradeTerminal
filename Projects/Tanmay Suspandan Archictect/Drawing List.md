When creating an Excel sheet to maintain all the drawings you have of a site, you should consider including the following headers or column titles:

1. Drawing Number: This should be a unique identifier for each drawing, often a combination of letters and numbers.

2. Drawing Title: A brief description of the content or purpose of the drawing.

3. Drawing Type: Specify the type of drawing, such as site plan, floor plan, elevation, section, detail, etc.

4. Revision Number: If applicable, include a column to track revisions or versions of the drawing.

5. Date: The date when the drawing was created or last revised.

6. Scale: Indicate the scale of the drawing, such as 1:100, 1/4" = 1'-0", etc.

7. Discipline: Specify the discipline or trade the drawing belongs to, such as architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, etc.

8. Location: If applicable, include a column to indicate the building, floor, or area the drawing represents.

9. Status: You may want a column to track the status of the drawing, such as "Issued for Construction," "Preliminary," "Approved," etc.

10. File Path: Include a column to reference the file path or location where the digital copy of the drawing is stored.

11. Notes: An optional column for any additional notes or remarks related to the drawing.

You can add or remove columns based on your specific requirements and the level of detail you need to track for your site drawings. It's always a good practice to include headers that will help you quickly identify and sort the drawings based on different criteria.

**Subject:** Urgent Resolution Required: Setup Incomplete and Neighbor's Internet Disruption

**Dear Airtel Broadband Team,**

I am writing to bring to your attention several issues I have encountered during the setup of the broadband service at my office. 

On , I purchased a 3-month 100 Mbps plan for my office. Today, your technician arrived to set up the router, but unfortunately, the setup process is still incomplete. The technician mentioned that there is a power issue preventing the installation from being completed. I kindly request that this issue be resolved as soon as possible so that my office can start using the broadband service.

Additionally, during the installation, your technician pulled a wire from another office instead of the correct one, resulting in a disruption to their internet service. The other office is now facing a complete internet shutdown and is understandably upset, blaming me for the issue. This has caused a strain on my relationship with my neighboring office, which I am keen to maintain positively.

I request your immediate intervention to resolve the following:

1. **Complete the setup of my broadband connection**: Ensure that the power issue is addressed and the installation is completed without further delay.
2. **Repair the internet connection of the neighboring office**: Your team should promptly rectify the issue caused by pulling the wrong wire and restore their service.
3. **Provide a resolution**: I would appreciate any guidance on how to manage this situation with my neighbors, as I believe this issue has arisen due to a mistake on your part.

Please treat this matter with urgency and provide me with an update on how you plan to address these issues. I trust that Airtel will take the necessary steps to ensure that both my office and the neighboring office receive the service we require.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

**Best regards,**

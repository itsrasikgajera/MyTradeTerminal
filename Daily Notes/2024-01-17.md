Dear Vipulbhai,

I trust this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that Dipak Dabhi is currently facing a medical emergency and is unable to attend the scheduled meeting. Additionally, he requires more time to push code into Gitlab.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding during this challenging time. Your cooperation is highly valued, and we look forward to your continued support as we navigate through this situation.

Thank you for your understanding.

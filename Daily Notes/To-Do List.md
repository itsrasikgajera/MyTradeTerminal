Sure, here are three types of projects that are often in demand in the freelancing product design UI/UX industry:

1. **Mobile App Design:** Designing user-friendly and visually appealing mobile applications is always in demand. With the surge in mobile app usage across various industries, clients often seek designers who can create intuitive interfaces for iOS, Android, or cross-platform apps. You might specialize in a particular niche (e.g., health, finance, social networking) or work on diverse projects to showcase versatility.
    
2. **E-commerce Platform UI/UX Design:** As online shopping continues to grow, businesses are constantly seeking ways to enhance user experiences on their e-commerce platforms. Designing intuitive navigation, seamless checkout processes, and engaging product displays are crucial for attracting and retaining customers. Showcasing your ability to optimize conversion rates and user interactions in an e-commerce setting can be a valuable addition to your portfolio.
    
3. **Dashboard and Analytics Design:** Many businesses rely on data-driven decisions, leading to a high demand for designers capable of creating intuitive dashboards and data visualization interfaces. This involves presenting complex information in a clear and user-friendly manner. Displaying your skills in simplifying complex data sets and creating visually compelling dashboards can attract clients looking to enhance their analytics platforms.
    

Remember, the key is not only to include these projects in your portfolio but also to showcase your process, problem-solving skills, and the impact of your designs on user experience and business goals. Adding case studies that highlight your approach, user research, wireframes, prototypes, and the final design can make your portfolio more compelling to potential clients.

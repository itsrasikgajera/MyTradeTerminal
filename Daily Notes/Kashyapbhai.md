Hi Kashyapbhai,

I hope you're doing well. I'll be near your office tomorrow and was wondering if you're available to meet up. I'd like to discuss how I can help add UI/UX services to your company's offerings, and also learn about any challenges you might be facing in doing so.

Let me know if tomorrow works for you.

Thanks,
Rasik Gajera

Here's the corrected version with proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation:

Hello Kashyap Bhai,

As we discussed in the previous meeting at your office, we mutually decided that I will share some of my key works to showcase on your website. I want to know how you need the projects presented. Do you need just images of the final projects or mockups? Do you also need a small case study for each project that includes an overview, problem statement, outcomes, key statistics, testimonials, and awards if any?

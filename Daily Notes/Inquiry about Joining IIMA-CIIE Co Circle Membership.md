I have been closely following the work of IIMA-CIIE for some time now and I am deeply impressed by your commitment to fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in India. As a designer passionate about building impactful products, I believe the Co Circle community could offer invaluable resources and support as I work towards my entrepreneurial goals.

While I am currently freelancing, I am actively working on developing my own organization. I believe that joining the Co Circle at this stage would be immensely beneficial, providing me with access to:

- **Mentorship:** The opportunity to learn from experienced entrepreneurs and mentors would be invaluable in shaping my vision and navigating the challenges of building a successful organization.
- **Community events:** Connecting with like-minded individuals and startups through exclusive events would allow me to build a strong network and learn from shared experiences.
- **Collaborative workspace:** Having access to well-equipped meeting spaces would provide a professional environment to work on my venture and foster collaboration with potential team members.

I understand that the Co Circle program is designed for established startups. However, I am confident that my skills, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit would make me a valuable addition to the community. I am eager to contribute to the collaborative atmosphere and learn from the diverse experiences of other members.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my eligibility for the Co Circle program in more detail. Please let me know if there are any additional documents or information you require from me. I am available for a call at your convenience.

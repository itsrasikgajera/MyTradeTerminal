# Update on Inquiry Regarding Account Status

Hi Samuel,

Thank you for your prompt response and keeping me informed about the progress regarding my account inquiry. I appreciate your efforts in communicating with the relevant team.

I completely understand the process might take some time, but I'm eager to have clarity on why my account has been disabled. Having access to my account is crucial for me, and I'm hoping for a resolution as soon as possible.

If there are any specific details or actions required from my end to expedite this process, please let me know. I'm more than willing to provide any necessary information or assistance needed to resolve this matter swiftly.

Thank you once again for your continued support and attention to this issue.

Best Regards, Rasik

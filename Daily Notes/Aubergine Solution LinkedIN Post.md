Absolutely thrilled to have been part of the Design Meetup at CIIE IIM Ahmedabad by Aubergine Solution Teams! 🚀✨

Yesterday was a day filled with inspiration, insights, and connections that will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of my design journey. 🎨🌐

The event brought together a passionate community of designers and design enthusiasts, fostering an environment of collaboration and knowledge-sharing. It was an honor to have industry leaders Parameswaran Venkataraman and Soo Basu join forces with Joel Gill, Maciej Biernat, and myself to delve into the evolution of design in India. 🇮🇳

Shiva Viswanathan expertly moderated a lively discussion that covered everything from design careers to the role of AI, and designing for Bharath. The energy in the room was electrifying, with the audience actively engaging with insightful questions. 🤔🌟

A special shoutout to Shell leaders Abhai Bhargava, Maya Sellon, Pavan Shahapur, Savvy Warrier, whose perspectives on their roles and contributions to end-customer experience added another layer of depth to the event. The Q&A sessions were a treasure trove of knowledge, touching on topics ranging from innovation to accessibility, analytics to strategy, and much more. 🌐💬

In the latter part of the meetup, Maciej Biernat and I had the privilege of sharing our experiences in scaling Shell's design team, and Laureano Marques provided valuable insights into driving Design Ops. 🚀💡

Heartfelt thanks to everyone who made this event possible, especially Akanksha Dutta, Sharon Sukumaran, Joel Mathew, Monica Mittal, and the DesignUp Conference team. Your behind-the-scenes efforts did not go unnoticed and contributed to the seamless execution of this fantastic gathering. 🙌🌈

Meeting incredible individuals, reconnecting with long-lost friends like Varun Anand, and witnessing the enthusiasm of over 50 attendees on a weekend was truly humbling. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share and learn from the superb conversations that unfolded. 🤝🌟  

As I reflect on the day, I can't help but feel a lingering euphoria. I'm uncertain if I'll ever outgrow the impact of this surreal Saturday, but one thing is certain – there's more to come! Stay tuned for the next chapter in this exciting design journey. 🚀🔮

Last Saturday, I attended a design meetup hosted by Aubergine Solutions, and it was amazing!

The first speaker, Pornima Bhaskaran, was incredible. She spoke about building creative confidence and how it connects to her life goals. It wasn't just a speech; it felt like I was walking in her shoes and learning how she makes her dreams come true. I left feeling inspired and ready to chase my own goals.

The afternoon's panel discussion was the real highlight. Big names like Sheel Damani, Akshay Vyas, Aranab Chakravarty, and Bhakti Dudhara discussed the future of design, led by the brilliant Sarvottam Kulkarni. They didn't just predict the future; they painted a picture of what it could be. Even with AI on the rise, they calmed our fears and reminded us that the key is to embrace change.

It's awesome to see these design leaders paving the way in such a fast-changing field. I'm so grateful I got to be there!

"Attention Please"

I want to buy YouTube for myself, which will cost me around 129 x 12 = 1548. However, any of you, a maximum of 6 people, want to buy the YouTube Premium Family plan. It will cost 189 x 12 = 2268 in total, but individually, it will only cost 378. That's only 1.3 per day.

**YouTube Premium Benefits**
- We will be free from annoying ads.
- We will get higher quality videos and original shows from YouTube.
- Background play with any video will be available.
- We can download videos in higher quality.
- You will also get free access to the YouTube Music App.

If any of you want to have YouTube Premium, please mark "yes" on this poll. Together, we can buy a plan and save some money.

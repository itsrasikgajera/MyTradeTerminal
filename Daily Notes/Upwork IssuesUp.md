Dear Angelica,

I hope this email finds you well.

Thank you for your previous correspondence regarding my query. I appreciate your efforts in looking into the matter for me.

I am writing to address a recent notification I received from Upwork regarding the status of my profile. I understand that my profile has been changed to "private" due to inactivity. I would like to request assistance in reactivating my profile so that I can continue utilizing Upwork for freelancing opportunities.

Furthermore, I am encountering difficulty in accessing my account to rectify this issue. I have attached a document outlining the specific challenges I am facing, including screenshots where applicable. I hope this provides clarity on the situation.

In addition to resolving the profile status, I would like to request a 1:1 video call to further discuss any necessary steps and to facilitate effective communication regarding my query. This will help ensure that all concerns are addressed promptly and accurately.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon with an update or to schedule the video call.

Best Regards,

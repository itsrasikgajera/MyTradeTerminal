As a UI Designer at Red Baton Design Studio, I create visually stunning and engaging designs for a variety of enterprise software products. I work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that my designs meet user needs and business goals, and create design systems to improve the consistency and efficiency of the design process. I also use rapid prototyping to test and iterate on my designs quickly, and develop data visualizations to communicate complex information in a clear and concise way.

I have over three years of hands-on experience in crafting user-centered and interactive digital interfaces, with a passion for translating complex concepts into intuitive and accessible designs. I have an advanced program in digital media and design from Maya Academy of Advanced Cinemetics, where I learned the fundamentals of color theory, typography, and layout principles. I am proficient in using Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch, and other tools to deliver visually appealing and seamless designs. I am also a continuous learner, dedicated to staying ahead in the ever-evolving field of UI design by expanding my skill set and keeping up with industry trends. I am always eager to connect with other design enthusiasts and explore how I can contribute to your design initiatives and help shape memorable user journeys.

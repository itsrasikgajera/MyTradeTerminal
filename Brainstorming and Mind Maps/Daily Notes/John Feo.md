Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been a while since we worked together at Red Baton, and I wanted to reconnect. I recently started my own agency, Sasvat Tech Solutions, and I’m reaching out to learn from experienced professionals like you.

Since you’re still at Red Baton, I’m really curious about how you’re handling sales—especially in finding leads, pitching to clients, and building your outreach lists. If you’re open to it, I’d love to hear about your approach and exchange some ideas.

This is a friendly request—nothing too formal. If you have some time for a quick chat, I’d really appreciate it!

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,  
Rasik Gajera

Hi Surbhi,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been a while since we worked together on those pitch decks when you were a sales intern at Red Baton. I wanted to reconnect and catch up on how things have been going for you.

I’ve recently started my own agency, Sasvat Tech Solutions, and I’m curious to learn more about how Red Button approaches client acquisition and pitches services. Since you were involved in sales, I’d love to hear any insights on how they identify potential clients and tailor their outreach.

This is just a friendly request—nothing too formal! If you’re open to it, I’d appreciate a quick chat whenever you have time.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,  
Rasik

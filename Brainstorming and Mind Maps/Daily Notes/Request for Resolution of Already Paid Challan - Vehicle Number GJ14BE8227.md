Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding my challan, which I have already paid, but I am still receiving notifications for outstanding dues.

Details of the challan are as follows:

- **Challan No**: GJ205890240712094422
- **Vehicle No**: GJ14BE8227
- **Outstanding Period**: 80 days
- **Notification Reference**: "To prevent any disruptions to your vehicle transactions, please settle the challan within the next 10 days."

I made the payment for this challan on **12th July 2024**, but it is still showing as unpaid on the mParivahan app. Despite this, I continue to receive messages stating that the payment is overdue.

To assist in resolving this matter, I have attached the following documents:

1. **Proof of Payment**, dated 12th July 2024.
2. **Screenshot from the mParivahan app** showing the current status of the challan.

I kindly request you to verify your records and update the status of the challan as paid. I would appreciate your prompt assistance in resolving this issue to avoid any further inconvenience.

Thank you for your attention and help in this matter.

Kind Regards,

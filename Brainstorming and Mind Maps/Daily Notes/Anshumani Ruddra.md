Hi, 

Please take a minute and read this before you message me. In the long run, this will save both of us a lot of time. 

I am open to speaking with founders looking for advice on the following: 
- building high-impact product teams at startups 
- thinking through product roadmaps
- gaming, social and content-based products 
- finding PMF, growth and revenue 
- coaching for founders and CXOs 
- fundraising 

I am also open to coaching senior product folks, but please be specific on how I can help and what problem (s) in your career you are currently trying to solve. 

If you would like to invite me for a podcast or a content partnership do add details in your note. 

If you want access to my time for a consultation or 1:1 advice, please head to [https://intro.co/anshumani](https://intro.co/anshumani) 

If you want to break into product management, please go through my blog ([https://anshumani.com/](https://anshumani.com/)) or YouTube channel which has a lot of useful content and my thoughts on product management. I get too many such requests, and unfortunately, I am not able to respond to them. 

Thanks!

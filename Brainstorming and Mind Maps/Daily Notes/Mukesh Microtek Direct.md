I hope this message finds you in good health.

Following our discussion with Miss Bhavi, I'm contacting you regarding scheduling a meeting. I've just sent you a message on WhatsApp for your convenience.

Could you please provide me with your email address for further correspondence? Additionally, I'd like to inquire about your availability for a meeting on Wednesday. Please let me know a suitable time, and I will do my best to accommodate it.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Rasik Gajera

  
Hello, Alkesh, 

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to update you on the pending payment for your invoice: I can allocate 8000 INR now, but I'm waiting for my client's request to proceed. Once confirmed, I'll promptly settle the remaining 4000 INR owed to you. 

Thanks for your understanding and patience. Feel free to reach out for more info.

Dear Nilesh Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important matter that has been on my mind for quite some time now. Over the past four months, I've been trying to meet with you to discuss starting my own digital agency.

I am eager for your guidance and mentorship as I embark on this journey. Given our positive relationship and the respect I have for your expertise, I cannot think of anyone better suited to offer me the necessary insights and support.

I understand that your time is valuable, and I genuinely appreciate any opportunity you can offer to meet with me and discuss this further. Your mentorship would not only mean a lot to me personally but also significantly contribute to my professional growth and development.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when we can arrange a meeting to discuss my plans for starting a digital agency and explore the possibility of you becoming my mentor.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Warm regards, 
Rasik

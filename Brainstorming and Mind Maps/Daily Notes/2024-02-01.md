Hello Vipulbhai,

I'm not feeling well, so I'm leaving the office now. Before I go, here's the update I can share with you:

- The images and illustrations for the Integrella websites are designed. You can download them from here
- https://www.figma.com/file/mftY8B9WWmyJGUMUz3gztf/Integrella-Website---Dev-File?type=design&node-id=2125-19140&mode=design. 
- Just select a frame, and on the right side, there's an option called "export" where you can choose to save as JPG, PDF, or PNG.

- I spoke with Deepak, and he won't be available for the meeting today.

- Regarding the Product Engineering Brochure, following our discussion with Paul, I've started working on a new design concept. I'll come up with two options by tomorrow. I'll first get your feedback before sharing them with Paul.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hello Dr. Vipal,

Thank you for your message! I am excited about the prospect of working on your mobile app.

We understand that app development costs can vary depending on the features and functionalities you envision. To provide the most accurate estimate, I would love to schedule a call to discuss your project in more detail.

During the meeting, we can delve into:

- **Your App's Goals:** What problem are you trying to solve, or what opportunity are you trying to capture?
- **Target Audience:** Who will be using your app? Understanding their needs is crucial.
- **Desired Features:** What functionalities do you envision for your app? Prioritizing features helps manage costs.
- **Complexity Level:** Will your app require simple interactions or more advanced features like real-time updates or integrations?

By collaboratively exploring these points, I can tailor a solution that meets your needs and budget. Once we have a clearer picture, I can provide a more precise cost estimate.

**Transparency and Flexibility**

I believe in transparent communication and flexible engagement models. I can discuss hourly rates or fixed-cost projects based on your preference.

**Ballpark Figure (Optional):**

While a definitive cost depends on the factors mentioned above, to give you a general idea, similar projects in the past have ranged from â‚¹5-6 lakhs INR.

**Next Steps:**

I'm flexible and happy to meet at your convenience, whether it's tomorrow, Sunday, or sometime next week.

I look forward to collaborating with you!

Best,
Rasik Gajera

Hello Suverna,

I hope you are doing well both in your career and health.

I am currently working as a freelancer, and I have a client who wants to develop a mobile application related to pregnancy education. If you have the time, could you please assist me in preparing some key questions to ask their future users? This will help me gain better insights and develop an effective solution for the client and their customers.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Rasik Gajera

Certainly! Here are ten user research questions you can ask pregnant women to understand their educational needs during pregnancy and build a useful app:

1. **Current Information Sources**
   - What sources do you currently use to get information about pregnancy (e.g., books, websites, apps, healthcare providers)?

2. **Content Preferences**
   - What types of information do you find most helpful during your pregnancy (e.g., nutrition, exercise, fetal development, mental health)?

3. **Information Gaps**
   - Are there any topics or questions about pregnancy that you struggle to find reliable information on?

4. **Feature Needs**
   - What features would you find most useful in a pregnancy education app (e.g., daily tips, appointment reminders, symptom tracker)?

5. **Engagement with Apps**
   - How often do you use pregnancy-related apps or websites, and what keeps you engaged with them?

6. **Personalization**
   - How important is it for you to receive personalized information based on your pregnancy stage and health conditions?

7. **Support Networks**
   - Do you participate in any online or offline support groups for pregnant women? If so, what do you like or dislike about them?

8. **Ease of Use**
   - What challenges do you face when using pregnancy-related apps or websites? What improvements would make them easier to use?

9. **Professional Guidance**
   - How do you prefer to receive information from healthcare professionals (e.g., in-person visits, telehealth, app notifications)?

10. **Emotional Support**
    - How important is it for the app to provide emotional support and mental health resources during your pregnancy?

These questions can help you gather comprehensive insights into the needs, preferences, and challenges of pregnant women, allowing you to design an app that effectively supports them through their pregnancy journey.

Dear Mr. Afsal,

Thank you for your prompt response regarding Saudi Arabian dates. I appreciate your clarification about the product range.

We are very interested in establishing a strong business relationship with Kiswa Dates in India through either of these potential arrangements:

1. Franchise Partnership: Becoming an official franchisee of Kiswa Dates in India
2. Distribution Partnership: Importing your premium Saudi Arabian dates for repackaging and marketing under a collaborative arrangement in the Indian market

Given India's growing demand for premium dates and our extensive market knowledge, we believe this could be a mutually beneficial partnership. We have the infrastructure and marketing capabilities to effectively position Kiswa Dates in the Indian market.

Would you be available for a 1:1 virtual meeting next week to discuss:
- Your franchise requirements and investment structure
- Import terms and pricing for bulk orders
- Marketing collaboration possibilities
- Quality standards and packaging requirements
- Territory rights and distribution framework

Please let me know your preferred date and time for the virtual meeting, and I'll arrange it accordingly.

Looking forward to a productive discussion about bringing Kiswa's premium Saudi Arabian dates to Indian consumers.

Best regards,

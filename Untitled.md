Hello Mayuri, 

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to apologize for my recent lack of communication. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized due to dengue fever, which made it impossible for me to respond earlier. The good news is that I’m now fully recovered and available to assist you with your needs.

Let’s connect at your earliest convenience so I can better understand your requirements and ensure everything is on track. 

For your convenience, you can also reach me at my official Integrella email address: rasik.gajera@integrella.com. This will help us maintain smooth communication moving forward.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,  
Rasik Gajera

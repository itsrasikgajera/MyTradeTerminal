Hi Ashlesha,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Rasik Gajera, and we crossed paths when you were working at Ravkoo. At that time, I was working with Bexcode in Ahmedabad, where Ravkoo was one of our valued clients.

I recently learned about your new venture, InTek Digital Solutions, and wanted to extend my heartfelt congratulations on this exciting journey!

As a freelance UI/UX designer, I believe there might be potential synergies between our work. I have extensive experience in crafting user-centric designs and enhancing the overall user experience for various digital platforms.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how I can support InTek Digital Solutions with my UI/UX design services. If you're open to it, could we schedule a brief call at your convenience?

Looking forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,

Rasik Gajera
